# Tic Tac Endeavour
A simple tic tac toe game with a twist

Written in everyone's favourite language, Java

--Status--

The game functions as a standard Tic-Tac-Toe game. Get three in a row to win. Painfully simple.

--How To Play--

1. Clone and run the code in your IDE of choice
2. Follow the in-game instructions
3. You will require a friend to play with as a CPU opponent is not yet an option

--Ambitions--

- Working CPU opponent, with difficulty toggle:
  - Easy: A quick game with no challenge, you will invariably win as the computer makes terrible choices intentionally
  - Breezy: The casual game with a standard challenge, the CPU will try to win, but not too hard
  - Sleazy: The CPU will actively try to cheat and undermine your success
- Larger grids (4x4, 5x5). The rules will shift depending on the size of the board (eg 5x5 will require 5 in a row to win)
- "Chaos" mode, the grid expands exponentionally and the game never ends. Put your CPU to the test and witness the application take control as you desperately search for the Task Manager.
