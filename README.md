# Tic Tac Endeavour
 A simple tic tac toe game with a twist

Written in everyone's favourite language, Java

Bear in mind this game is not finished and most likely never will be. Nevertheless, it stands to serve a insight into my skills as a budding Java developer

--How To Play--

1. Clone and run the code in your IDE of choice
2. Follow the in-game instructions
3. You will require a friend to play with as a CPU opponent is not yet an option

--Ambitions--

- Working CPU opponent
- Larger grids (4x4, 5x5)
- "Chaos" mode, the grid expands exponentionally and the game never ends.
